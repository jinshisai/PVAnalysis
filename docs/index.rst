SLAM (Spectral Line Analysis/Modeling) is a python library to analyze/model spectral line data especially obtained with radio telescopes. The current main package, pvanalysis, is to derive the rotational velocity as a function of radius and fit the profile with a power-law function. The detail of the method is presented in Aso et al. 2015, Sai et al. 2020 and the reference therein. More analysis tools will be coming in future.
